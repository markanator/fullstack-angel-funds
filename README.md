# **_Fullstack VR Funding_**

### **About**

"Virtual Reality Funds" is a portfolio remake of a past project. The task was to build a platform that provides tech entrepreneurs with limited resources access to business training, project capital raising and mentoring.

### **What did this project entail?**

In the original [team repo](https://github.com/virtual-reality-funding-platform1/back-end) I was tasked with creating a RESTful API using Node/Express/JWT.

I watched and completed Ben Awad's [14-hour Fullstack React, GraphQL, TS Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8&t=19555s) in under a week and I was hooked on the tech used! I wanted more and I wanted something original.

In this project, I wanted to challenge myself by making a GraphQL Server that utilizes Redis all in TypeScript, while also using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend.

### **What was the most enjoyable part of the project?**

I enjoyed the thrill of the unknown and having to research the documentations before coming to a solution. It wasn't easy and it certainly was a process, but I learned a lot from it.

### **What did you find most technically challenging?**

### _For the backend:_

I had to wrap my head around using decorators for type-orm and type-grapql at first, but quickly familiarized myselg with them.

Cookies weren't working when they the front end and back end were hosted, I had to research how to fix that. The backend is hosted for free on heroku with a different domain.

### _For the frontend:_

I originally started this project with [PUG.js](https://pugjs.org/),switched to [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), switched to [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), and landed with Next.js.

I wanted to add stripe payments as challenge rather than using a barebones custom option, that was surprisingly easier than I had imagined.

### **What is functional about your project, and what is still a work in progress?**

User's can create an account, make projects, donate to projects.

I would like to go back and work on mobile responsiveness. I'd like to add more content to the user's dashboard page, so they can track the status of their projects.

I can always add more content to flesh it out more but this is more of a "using new tech" challenge.
